# TALKING CUP

This little project uses a standard coffee paper cup, a 1W speaker and a Feather M0+ WiFi to play a sound once the user touches a given area on the cup. The audio files are provided through an SD card and the sound selection happens through rotating the cup on the left or the right side.

The played files can be selected through the website hosted by the WiFi web server.
